Many locations steeped in history such as the Rütliwiese, the Schillerstein and Tell Chapel greet guests with their original Swiss charms. In the evening, Lucerne harbour – located right next to the famous Chapel Bridge – welcomes the travelers. And by the way: The journey can easily be traveled in the opposite direction, too.\n\nApart from the many sights, passengers enjoy special presentations about history, myths and legends around Gotthard during this historic journey through time. Last but not least, the culinary aspect will not be neglected: Guests may indulge in warm meals on the steamboat or enjoy snacks and beverages on the train.",
