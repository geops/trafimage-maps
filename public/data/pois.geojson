All through the year, the cog railway runs steeply up from Kleine Scheidegg through a tunnel to the Jungfraujoch.\n\nThe tunnel leading up from the station Eigergletscher is seven kilometres in length and was built between 1896 and 1912. One stop within the tunnel offers spectacular views onto the glacier world outside through windows. On the summit, you will be greeted by a high-Alpine wonder world made of ice, snow and rocks. All of this can be marvelled at from the viewing platforms “Sphinx” and “Plateau” on the Aletsch glacier or from the “Ice Palace”.",

The open air coaches truly bring you closer to nature and let you take perfect photos of the breathtaking scenery.\n\nCrossing the Alps in the Bernina Express certainly is one of the most spectacular ways to do it. Along the way, the Bernina Express rolls Hollywood-style over the 65 meter tall Landwasser Viaduct, the signature structure of the Rhaetian Railway and the UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nAltogether the train passes through 55 tunnels and over 196 bridges on its way from Chur to Tirano. Travellers are treated to marvellous sights during their journey, like the Montebello curve with a view of the Bernina massif, the Morteratsch glacier, the three lakes Lej Pitschen, Lej Nair and Lago Bianco, the Alp Grüm and the Brusio Circular Viaduct.\n\nIn summer, the journey can be extended from Tirano to Lugano aboard the Bernina Express Bus.",

But how is cheese actually made? “Le Chalet Bio” answers this question. In the cozy restaurant with an integrated show dairy, a cheese with the same name is produced in the traditional manner over wood fire.\n\nYou will experience up close how the tasty hard cheese is made from 200 litres of organic milk. Right then and there, you can convince yourself of how delicious the cheese tastes by enjoying an organic fondue. After lunch, the “Vieux Pays-d’Enhaut” museum is well worth a visit.",
